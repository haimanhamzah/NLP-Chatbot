## What does this chatbot do? 
This chatbot was implemented to answer simple questions, have a chat with, cheer you up with a joke if you're feeling upset and even book a movie for you 

## How do i use the chatbot? 
### DISCLAIMER: Please run nltk.download('stopwords'), nltk.download('punkt'), nltk.download('wordnet'), nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') and nltk.download('universal_tagset') in the code file first before attempting to run.
### DISCLAIMER: Ensure you are in the correct directory as well.

### First
The main file in the directory is called 'start.py'. Run that file and it may take a few seconds before a prompt would be initialized in the command line interface asking for your name

### Second
Proceed to type in your name or any basic grammatical method of introducing yourself such as e.g. my name is Haiman. (Please don't attempt to be yoda and mess up the order like 'haiman my name is', it would not work)

### Third
It would then ask you how you feel as a sentiment analysis towards the users perspective. you are allowed to skip by just pressing enter, inserting a positive feeling or inserting a negative feeling. If a negative feeling is detected
it would then ask the user if they would like to hear a joke to boost their morale up. this requires an explicit confirmation from the user to approve if they would like to hear a joke or not. 

### Fourth
This is the main interface of the chatbot, firstly you can ask the chatbot to tell you your name by just typing 'what is my name?'

### Fifth 
You can even enter any sort of simple questions like 'what are stock and bonds?' for the chatbot to answer.

### Sixth
Aside from that, there is also a possibility to enter the Movie bot, to book a movie. There are a few instructions written regarding the movie bot's prompts in the Command line interface, and so in order to book a movie, just follow the instructions listed.

### Seventh
